# countdown.js
countdown.js is a small JS library for countdown timers.

## Installation
* Move the file named `countdown.js` into the desired directory and link it with `<script>` tags from the desired HTML file.
* At the top of `countdown.js`, there's an array of objects, named `events`. By default there are three placeholders. Replace them with the events you want (or remove them, or add new ones).
* Create elements with `id`s of `#cd-[unit]`, where `[unit]` is the unit of time you want to display. These will be filled with the number of those units which is left.

See `example.html` for an example.
